						The star of our solar system is called the Sun, it is located in the centre of our solar system and it takes 99.8% of the
						solar system's mass. It is our source of energy, heat and light. Without Sun, none of the organisms on Earth would be able to survive.

				The <span style="color:red; font-size:25px">Mercury</span> is the closet planet to the Sun in distance. It is slightly larger than Earth's moon and
				orbits the sun in less than 90 days. Fun fact: Mercury is not made out of mercury, it is actually made out of rocks and has a thin layer of atmosphere
				composed of oxygen, helium and hydrogen. 
				</p>
				<p><span style="color:orange; font-size:25px">Venus</span> is Earth's twin brother in size, but only in size. With it's thick, toxic layer of sulfuric 
				acid atmosphere, the temperature and pressure on Venus is extremely high.
				</p>
				<p>Our home, <span style="color:yellow; font-size:25px">Earth</span> is the third planet from Sun and is the only known planet to harbour life and has
				sufficient liquid water on surface.
				</p>
				<p><span style="color:magenta; font-size:25px">Mars</span> is the last of the four inner planets. Despite its size difference, Mars actually shares the
				most similarities to Earth. Scientists believe that Mars used to be covered with liquid water and possibly life forms just like Earth. However, due to
				its thin layer of atmosphere, Mars lost its liquid water and only has ice layers at its poles nowadays. 
				</p>
				<p>
				The <span style="color:green; font-size:25px">Asteroid Belt</span> seperates the inner solar system from the outer solar system. It is very dangerous
				to drive your spaceship across it!
				</p>
				<p>Being the most massive planet, <span style="color:rgb(245, 188, 66); font-size:25px">Jupiter</span> is two times heavier than all the other planets combined. 
				Completed made out of gas, one of Jupiter's most remarkable characteristics is its "red eyes", or swirling storms that are more than 10000 miles wide.
				</p>
				<p>
				First discovered in the early 1600s, <span style="color:rgb(235, 52, 125); font-size:25px">Saturn</span> is most known for its beautiful rings. 
				It is also a gaseous planet with the most moons in the solar system.
				</p>
				<p>
				<span style="color:cyan; font-size:25px">Uranus</span> is the seventh planet from the Sun, also the oddest. it rotates from east to west, but its 
				equator is tilted, make it basically rotates on its side.
				</p>
				<p>
				The eighth planet from the sun, <span style="color:blue; font-size:25px">Neptune</span> is the first planet to be mathematically predicted before 
				actually discovered. Due to the odd orbit of Uranus, scientists figured out that there should be another planet exist. They calculated Neptune's location
				and found it on the telescope. Neptune is known for its supersonic winds, which exceed 1500mph.
